# BEEYOND
Implementation of the sensor modules in BEEYOND project as well as the data handling by the Base Station

The Website for this project can be found at - http://tiny.cc/BEEYOND 
The full WPF App can be found and downloaded from https://github.com/leinadfc/BEE-YOND repo and I encourage you to download and try it yourself. 

The usefulness of the code in this repo will depend on the exact implementation of our project that we hope to be able to make available soon.
